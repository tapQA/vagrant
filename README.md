# vagrant

Using Vagrant allows:
- all members of a tapQA team to have an identical development environment

- easy access to a different OS to test on

### To use

Clone this repo or
copy & save a specific Vagrantfile

Open a command prompt or terminal

Cd to the folder with the chosen Vagrantfile
